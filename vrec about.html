    Hello everyone Iam Rahul gnanann welcome to my page. Actually this page includes how we love our college and love towards our branch. This is our collage and our lecturers and there are some friendly and strict(serious) lecturers but in there strictness also we can find friendly vibe in them. Interacting with them gives a new experience to us, as well as interacting with other branch students is quite intresting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
